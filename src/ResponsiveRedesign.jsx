        A complete overhaul and redesign of a still-active website created at
        the dawn of the internet age.
      </h6>
      <h2 className="project-title">Usability Issues</h2>
      <h6 className="project-date">
        Too many menus (navigation bar across, customer pane top right, search
        pane left, category pane left, sort headers across, second nav bar
        bottom)
      </h6>
      <h6 className="project-date">
        Too much text; no images (even physical descriptors like scuffed label
        are typed not pictured)
      </h6>
      <h6 className="project-date">Colors/logos/images outdated</h6>
      <h6 className="project-date">“Add” button doesn’t specify quantity</h6>
      <h6 className="project-date">Rating system outdated</h6>
      <h6 className="project-date">
        Difficult to learn (interface doesn’t match typical ecommerce sites
        users are used to, too much going on)
      </h6>
      <h6 className="project-date">
        Some text is actually images of text (top right customer pane)
      </h6>
      <h2 className="project-title">Accessibility Test Summary</h2>
      <h6 className="project-date">
        Many of the accessibility concerns are valid. The lack of alternative
        text likely hurts the site’s SEO, its missing language and region hurt
        accessibility, and its low contrast is simply bad design. However, there
        are some areas where I believe WAVE was too harsh. For example, the site
        is laid out using layout tables. While perhaps not best practice,
        there’s no denying that the site’s elements (however old or outdated or
        poorly designed they may be) are laid out with structure and in a
        somewhat responsive manner. Further, WAVE detected broken and redundant
        links. However, these are neither broken nor redundant but rather used
        to sort the site’s main table. I don’t agree with their presence because
        I think there are better ways to let the user to sort—but
        realistically—the links do, in fact, work.

      <h2 className="project-title">Conclusion</h2>
      <h6 className="project-date">
        Through Responsive Redesign, I learned the importance of staying
        current. With UI/UX, although functionality is principally important, it
        is not everything. Yes, FineWineCollector.com works. However, it is not
        at all current—something that likely turns away potential customers.
        Even though a completely legitimate site, users must think on occaision
        that it is a scam or their information is unsecure givent the obselete
        interface (as evidenced by the TrustPilot button on footer). This
        project showed me how just some effort into redesign utilizing an
        accessibility tester can go a long way.
